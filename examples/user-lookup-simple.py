# Script Information
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
Purpose: 
    A simple example script for pulling user account information 
    with the handy osometweet package. It is meant to show you 
    how to use the method, but also how it is working. 

Author: Matthew DeVerna
Date: Dec. 17th 2020
"""


# First things first, import the package
from osometweet.api import OsomeTweet

# Now we can initialize an object w. the of the OsomeTweet class
ot = OsomeTweet()


"""
Now with this object `ot` you have access to a number of
different helpful methods for getting Twitter data. 

This script will show you how to use the .user_lookup_ids()
method.

The second thing we need to do is set our 
user tokens to get Oauth_1.0a authortization.

#### Access your keys/tokens ###
To find your access tokens/keys, you can visit the below
site. 
  - https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps

Once there click "Edit" next to "App Permisions." 
Next, select "Keys and Tokens." What you're looking for 
is under "Access token & secret." You can regenerate these
if you have forgotten them, however, keep in mind this will
change your access keys/tokens and may break other code
that relied on those tokens/keys.
"""

# To set your enviornment variables, in your terminal execute
# a command like:
#       export 'CONSUMER_KEY'='<your_consumer_token>'
# replacinging <your_consumer_token> with the tokens that 
# Twitter provided you. Repeat this process for each token 
# that you need. This set's environment variables that you
# can load using the `os.environ.get()` method as you see
# below.

# Set Twitter tokens/keys.
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
consumer_key = os.environ.get("CONSUMER_KEY")
consumer_secret = os.environ.get("CONSUMER_SECRET")
access_token = os.environ.get("ACCESS_TOKEN")
access_token_secret = os.environ.get("ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET")

# With these keys/tokens, we can pass them to the OsomeTweet
# object (ot) by using the below method
ot.set_oauth_1a_creds(
    consumer_key=consumer_key,
    consumer_secret=consumer_secret,
    access_token=access_token,
    access_token_secret=access_token_secret
)

# The keys have been given to the OsomeTweet object (ot),
# however, with those tokens in the ot object, we can now
# set up an Oauth1Session by simply calling the below function.
oauth_1a = ot.get_oauth_1a()

"""
Now with this oauth_1a object, we can begin to pull data
by using the .user_lookup_ids() method. First, lets take a
look at the methods docstring...
~~~
Signature:
ot.user_lookup_ids(
    oauth_1a: requests_oauthlib.oauth1_session.OAuth1Session,
    u_ids: Union[list, tuple],
    user_fields: Union[list, tuple] = ['id', 'name', 'username'],
) -> requests.models.Response
Docstring:
Looks-up user account information using unique user id numbers. 
User fields included by default match the default parameters from twitter.
Ref: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/api-reference/get-users

:param [list, tuple] u_ids - Unique user_id numbers (max 100)
:param [list, tuple] user_fields - Twitter's user.fields parameters.
:returns requests.models.Response
:raises Exception, ValueError
Type:      method
~~~

So this method takes in an OAuth1Session object (created 
with the .get_oauth_1a() method), a list (or tuple) of
user ids (100 user_ids max), and a list (or tuple) of 
user_fields (from those available via the link above).
The method defaults to including the user_fields below...
    - id, name, username
... because these are the default fields set by Twitter when
calling the endpoint without passing any user_fields.

Here's what it looks likeÂ in use...
"""

# Set some test IDs (these are Twitter's own accounts)
ids2find = ["2244994945", "6253282"]

# Call the function without any additional user_fields
response = ot.user_lookup_ids(
    oauth_1a=oauth_1a,
    u_ids=ids2find
)

# To call the function with different user_fields
# comment out the above code and uncomment the
# code below, then run the script again and 
# take a look at the new fields returned.

# new_user_fields = [
#     "created_at", "description",
#     "entities", "public_metrics"
# ]
# response = ot.user_lookup_ids(
#     oauth_1a=oauth_1a,
#     u_ids=ids2find,
#     user_fields=new_user_fields
# )

# The .user_lookup_ids() method utilizes the response
# package to communicate with twitter, so it returns a
# response object. There is a lot of different
# information in this object, but the data can be found
# by doing the following
data = response.json()["data"]

# The data object above is a list of dictionaries. Thus,
# we can iterate through the data returned for each user
# by doing the below.

for user in data:
    print(user)

"""
To gather data from specific fields (e.g. the `id` 
number) within the for loop you can access it by
calling user.get("id") or user["id"]

Finally, wou will also get errors for users which 
can't be found by calling using the response object
with:
    errors = response.json()['errors']
this is not used here because the Twitter accounts
will never return errors. If this is the case, the
errors object will simply become a None type object.
